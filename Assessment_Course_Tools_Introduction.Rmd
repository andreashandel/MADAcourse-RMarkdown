# Module Assessments

Each module comes with an assessment. Those are things you need to do that will be graded. Each module has a document, like this one, which describes what the assessments are. Often, there is a good bit of information for the exercises.

## Quiz

Get the quiz sheet for this module from the general [**Assessments**](./Course_Assessments.html) page. Fill it in, then submit to the online grading system before the deadline.

## Exercise

For this module, you are asked to do a project for which you will be using Github, R, RStudio, and Quarto to create the start of a website which will become your portfolio for this class. You'll write and post a short personal introduction of yourself.


### Workload Note

For those of you who are new to Github/R/Quarto, this first project will make you do a lot of things that you are not be familiar with. I know that this will be time-consuming and also might feel a bit intimidating. It's partly unavoidable and partly on purpose. You need to learn how to quickly get up to speed with all kinds of new tools that come your way. So practicing it is a good idea. You are welcome to draw on any sources for help that you want (online, classmates, instructor, etc.). I'm confident with a bit of trial and error you'll get it to work.

If you get stuck (quite possible), check the materials listed in the **Resources** section of the course, or use Google. Also use the discussion boards to ask questions. You may use any method to get help (Google, R4Ds Slack channel, colleagues/friends/relatives with R/Quarto/Markdown experience, etc.). Still, try to do as much as possible yourself. We'll use all the bits you are learning here repeatedly during this course.

### Pre-requisites

You should have set up with all the tools we need, namely R, RStudio, GitHub and GitKraken (or your preferred Git client).


### Github setup

-   I made a template for you to get started. Go to [this page](https://github.com/andreashandel/online-portfolio-template). Make sure you are logged into GitHub, then click on `Use this template`. Create a new repository, call it `yourname-MADA-portfolio` (`yourname` should include both your first and last name, e.g. `andreashandel-MADA-portfolio`.) Choose public repository, then create it.

-   Next, **clone** the repository (which will be something like `https://github.com/USERNAME/yourname-MADA-portfolio/`) from Github.com to your local computer (using Gitkraken or whatever software/method you decided to use). I recommend that you make a folder somewhere on your computer (e.g., called *MADA2023*) and place all class-related repositories (of which this is the first one) into this folder. Remember that these repositories/folders should **not** be synced with some other software (e.g., Dropbox).



### Quick local website check

Once your repository is on your local computer, go into the folder and click on `online_portfolio.Rproj`, which should open RStudio. In the bottom right, you'll see several files that are part of your repository/project. We'll edit a bunch of them shortly. In the top right panel in RStudio, you should see a `Build` tab. Click on it. It should show a `Render website` button, click it. You might get complaints about missing packages, if that's the case, install them. If everything works well, a local preview of your soon-to-be new website should open in your browser.

If you got that far, let's create some content.


### Quarto content creation

**For this part of the task, [this comprehensive Quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) and [the Quarto section of the work-in-progress 2nd edition of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto.html) will likely be useful.**

Open `index.qmd`. This is the main landing page for your website. Change the text however you want to. What you are writing here is Markdown, so now would be a good time to check out some of the Markdown resources and play with them. You will also see at the top of your R Studio window two buttons `Source` and `Visual`. This allows you to switch between editing Markdown in plain format, and using a visual editor. It's a good idea to switch back and forth to start to learn how certain graphical elements look like in plain text formatting. You'll likely be using a mix of visual and source view a lot.


Next, open `aboutme.qmd` and write some text introducing yourself, as follows:

-   Talk a bit about yourself, your background, training, research interests. Let me/us know what kind of statistics, programming, data analysis experience you already have. I'd also be curious to know what you most hope to learn in this course. And then talk about (at least one) interesting personal fact(s) about you.
-   Give your text a nice structure with headings, subheadings, etc.
-   Include a picture of yourself. To do so, place the picture in the repository and link it from the Quarto file.
-   Finally, include a link to a picture/video/website/etc. The linked material should be somehow related to data analysis. Find something that you think is really cool/interesting/weird/etc. Provide a few explanatory sentences.
-   If you want, feel free to get creative and include other things. You can play with Quarto if you wish to, e.g., you can try to include some table or a video or whatever.

*Every time you make changes and want to see how they look, just save your changes and re-load the website in our browser, it should show you any changes.*


### Styling

You can style your website if you like. Full styling will require knowledge of CSS and HTML. We won't get into this. But if you want to play a bit with the look, open the `_quarto.yml` file. This file defines the menu structure, and some styling. To change the look, you can replace `theme` with a different one. [Many themes are available](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html). Try some, see how things change. You can do a lot more styling by for instance editing the `styles.css` file. This is not a web design class `r emoji::emoji('grin')`, we therefore won't go into styling further, but feel free to explore on your own.


Also go ahead and replace the `URL-TO-THIS-REPOSITORY-HERE` placeholder text in `_quarto.yml` with the actual Github URL of the repository you just created (e.g. something like `https://github.com/andreashandel/andreashandel-MADA-portfolio`). 



### Sending updates to Github

Once you are happy with your updates, or if you want to take a break, make sure to push your updates to GitHub. First close RStudio. Then go to the program you use for Github (I will assume that it's GitKraken. If you use something else the details might vary). In the top right of Gitkraken, there should be a notification about changed files. Click *view changes*, then *Stage all changes*. Write a commit message, commit the changes. You should see the *main* with the computer symbol moved above the one with some random logo. That means your local repository is ahead of the one on github.com. To get them in sync, you click the *push* button. If things work, the two symbols should now be in the same line.

::: note
Sometimes, there might be issues that prevent syncing, e.g., if someone else changed the same files you did. If you are sure your local version is the correct one, you can perform a **force push**. A force push will overwrite the remote repo with the local repo forcibly. This means that the remote will be updated with any changes that exist on your local computer. If any changes have been made to the code since you began editing (i.e. someone else has made a commit to the repo while you were working on it) they will be **destroyed** by the force push since they are not on your local repo. For this assignment, you are the only person working on your introduction so it is unlikely you will encounter any issues with force push, but it is good to be aware of the function of the action. Use with care. It's generally better to [resolve merge conflicts.](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/how-to-resolve-merge-conflict-in-git)

### Making the website public

We want to set things such that your repository can at the same time become a public website. Github allows you to do that with its [*Github Pages*](https://pages.github.com/) feature. To turn on the *Github Pages* feature, go to your repository on github.com (e.g. something like `https://github.com/andreashandel/andreashandel-MADA-portfolio`). On the top of the website for your repository, you should see a `Settings` button. Click on it and then find the `Pages` section. In the `Branch` section, switch `none` to `main` and folder as `/docs`. Click `Save`. 

This should now have turned on your website. You might have gotten a notice about the location of your new website. If yes, follow the link. If not, you can get there by going to a URL that has the form `https://username.github.io/yourname-MADA-portfolio/` (e.g. for me, that is `https://andreashandel.github.io/andreashandel-MADA-portfolio/`). It might take a few seconds before the page is available, if you get a 'not found' error, wait a bit and try again. If everything works, your website is now public!


### Github pages

We used the Github pages feature to create the website. You might have noticed that the files for your new website live on the domain `github.com`, while your nice-looking website lives at the domain `github.io`. This is how Github Pages work. It take files from your repository and turns them into a website with a distinct URL. Those files can either be in the main repository folder or in a `/docs` subfolder (our setup). Your website URL and your repository URL are distinct. All github actions, like pushing, pulling, cloning, etc. are done with the repository on the `github.com` domain. The `github.io` domain is only there to display websites.

As an example, this course website is displayed at <https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/> and all the files that make up the webpage are at [(https://github.com/andreashandel/MADAcourse)](https://github.com/andreashandel/MADAcourse). Note the text at the bottom of the repository view. That text comes from the `Readme.md` file. Speaking of which...


### Update your repository Readme file

Re-open your project with RStudio. Click to open the README.md file. It only contains a single sentence I placed there. This file will not be part of your website, but it is what people see if they land at your github repository (i.e. the behind-the-scenes location). 
Add some text to it that points users to the URL for your new website. (You've done the reverse above, allowing users to quickly go from your website to your Github repository).

Make any other edits you like.

Once done with edits, remember to re-build/re-render your website with Quarto (by clicking 'Render Website' in the `Build` tab) and then committing/pushing your local changes to GitHub (using Gitkraken or another Git client).



### General Github workflow

In the future, if you work on repositories like this one (or any others), your workflow should be as follows: 

* Open GitKraken or your preferred Git client and make sure the local copy of your repository is up-to-date (this is important if you collaborate with someone or you are working on multiple computers). If the remote is ahead of the local, do a **pull**. 
* Once your local repo is up-to-date, open your project in RStudio by double-clicking the name of the project (ends in .Rproj). Make all the edits you like. Make sure to render your quarto files (or knit your Rmd files). Once you are done with edits, close Rstudio, go to Gitkraken, **stage/commit/push** your changes back to the remote server.

**You will be using this workflow a lot**.


### Further information

I wrote a tutorial a while back describing the setup with Github pages. It has some additional information and you can [check it out here](https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/github-website/). Note that this tutorial still used R Markdown instead of Quarto. Some of the information still applies, other parts are different with Quarto.

Using Github pages makes it fairly easy to create websites. I currently host all my course websites in this way. What we created was a fairly basic page. It is easy with Quarto to create other, more full-featured websites. For instance [my personal website](https://www.andreashandel.com/) uses Quarto. If you are interested in such a more full-featured approach, check out [this part of the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/). You can also find a few more links to other resources [here](https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/2022-10-01-hugo-to-quarto-migration/).


## Discussion

The discussion for this module is all about your introductions. For your original post, simply post the URL to your newly created website into the `introductions` slack channel. **Do so by Wednesday.**

For your replies, visit some of your classmates websites and leave feedback as a reply to their initial Slack post.

I hope this will allow you to start getting to know each other, even if only virtually.
