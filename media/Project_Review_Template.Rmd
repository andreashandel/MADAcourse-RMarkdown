Are all results fully reproducible? Is documentation provided which clearly explains how to reproduce things, and does it work without the need for any manual intervention?

### Feedback and Comments

WRITE YOUR FEEDBACK HERE


### Summary assessment
* major parts not reproducible 
* small parts not reproducible or required manual intervention 
* fully reproducible without issues
