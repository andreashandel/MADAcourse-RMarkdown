## Textbook and Other Course Material

There is no required textbook. We will make use of several freely available textbooks and other materials. All course materials will be provided. We will use the R software for data analysis, which is freely available for download. 

## Course Description

This course provides a survey of modern statistical approaches to analyze data. We will cover a variety of modern approaches for analyzing and interpreting data commonly encountered in public health, biomedical sciences, and related areas. This is an applied, hands-on class. We will use real data (bring your own data if you have it) to learn different methods of analysis. We will discuss all the steps of a data analysis, including obtaining and cleaning data, exploratory and full analysis, and presentation of results.

We will discuss how to formulate scientifically solid questions for a given set of data, how to decide on the right method of analysis, how to implement the analysis in R, and how to present and communicate the results. We will cover statistical methods such as regression, tree based models, cross-validation, bootstrapping, model selection and more. 

## Course Learning Objectives

The main goal for this course is for you to learn the whole process of performing a data analysis project. This starts with identifying a suitable question-data pair, to getting, cleaning and exploring the data, all the way to fitting statistical models and producing materials that communicate what you did and found. A second goal is to introduce you to some modern analysis approaches that these days often go by the name of 'Machine Learning'. Finally, a related goal is to introduce you to a set of tools that allow for a modern, reproducible workflow of your analyis.

The specific learning objectives that I hope you will achieve by going through this course are:

_Design_

* Given a data set, define the questions that can be answered and formulate and implement suitable analytic approaches.
* Given a data science question, determine the type of data and analytic approach needed to answer it.

_Processing_

* Know how to obtain, process and analyze data from a variety of different sources.
* Be knowledgeable about data types and standards and what analysis methods to apply to specific situations.
* Be able to thoughtfully and critically assess strengths and weaknesses of specific data sets and process and analyze the data appropriately.

_Analysis_

* Critically compare and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different data analysis approaches. 
* Judge the appropriateness of different approaches for specific questions and data sets and know how to apply an appropriate analytic approach.
* Design and implement successful data analyses using state-of-the-art analysis software to translate data to information and knowledge that leads to actionable insights.

_Communication_

* Summarize analysis results in ways that provide actionable conclusions and that are easily understandable by different audiences, such as laypersons, decision makers, and expert colleagues.
* Assess the strengths and weaknesses of different formats for representing the results of data analyses.

_Tools_

* Explain the importance of workflow, project management, and reproducibility tools, and know how to use those tools.
* Be comfortable using R and Github to do data analysis in a reproducible manner.
* Be able to quickly learn how to use new software and tools, figure out how to get help when stuck, and make it work for you.

_Overall_

* Judge the usefulness and appropriateness of data analyses described in the primary research literature.
* Learn to _look over your shoulder_ and critically assess what you are doing, what assumptions you make by doing certain things, and if and how you can justify these.


## Grading

The grade will be made up as follows:

* 20% online quizzes
* 20% homework/small projects
* 20% participation/discussions
* 40% a course long project, broken up into pieces. 

The following grading scale will be used, final grades might be curved (upward): A 93-100, A- 90-93, B+ 87-90, B 83-87, B- 80-83, C+ 77-80, C 73-77, C- 70-73, D 60-70, F < 60


## Class Attendance, Make-up Policy

This class is online. You are expected to submit all assignments by their due dates. Excused misses of due dates are only provided by prior agreement with the instructor or for special reasons (medical, etc.).


## Prerequisites

This is a quantitative course. We will not discuss the mathematical details of specific data analysis approaches, however some statistical background and being comfortable with quantitative thinking are useful. Previous experience with writing computer programs in general and R in particular is also helpful, but not necessary. If you have no programming experience, expect to spend extra time getting yourself familiar with R. As long as you are willing to invest the time to learn the programming and you do not mind thinking quantitatively, you should be able to take the course, independent of your background.

_Formal requirement for the course is BIOS7010. Knowledge of material from BIOS7010 is assumed. If you didn't take this course, please contact me to get permission to enroll._

## Getting Help

If you have questions about any aspect of the course, please do not hesitate to ask for help. The course materials describe in detail the ways you can ask for help.


## University Honor Code and Academic Honesty Policy

All academic work must meet the standards contained in _A Culture of Honesty_. All students are responsible to inform themselves about those standards before performing any academic work. More detailed information about academic honesty can be found at: http://www.uga.edu/honesty/

Discussions with your classmates and the instructor are encouraged. However, the final work should be your own.


## Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who require reasonable accommodations in order to participate in course activities or meet course requirements should contact the instructor.

## General Disclaimers

This syllabus is a general plan, deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.
