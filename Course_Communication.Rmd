The main mode of communication will be through the discussion boards on eLC. Use them widely to ask questions, to answer others' questions, to notify me and others of things that are unclear/wrong, to post links to interesting resources, etc. I hope we can use the discussion boards to build a _community of learners_ where you help and support each other. So please don't always wait for me to answer questions or provide feedback! Engage with each other. I will regularly visit and read the discussions and participate, but I hope that I will end up as one participant of many, not the only person providing answers.

I will use eLC to post announcements. Check regularly. They should show up when you log into the course and should also be in the announcements section.

I prefer you use the discussion boards instead of email to ask questions. The reason is that if you have a question, it is likely that others have it too. By asking and answering on the discussion boards, everyone can see it. That said, there might be instances where the question only relates to you. In such cases, feel free to email me directly. __Please do not email through eLC, because of the insane way it is configured, with usg email addresses, the emails often do not reach me.__ Send email directly to my ahandel@uga.edu address.

If you get stuck badly enough that asynchronous discussion or email doesn't help, or if there are other reasons you want to talk in real time, let me know and we can either set up a video conversation (skype or zoom) or you can come by my office if you are on campus. 

We will also use Github for some specific communications, detailed instructions on that will be provided.

eLC is at times a bit clunky and not too user-friendly. I considered using alternatives (e.g. Slack or our Github organization), but decided that it would be just one more tool to learn and that additional learning might not outweigh potential benefits. _However_ if you find the eLC discussions are just not working because of how tedious they are to navigate, let me know and we can set up some other form of group communication.
